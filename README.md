It has been decided to make a minimum viable product of the new game voted 'most likely to succeed 2019'. 
This fantastic piece of the story writer's art is known as 'ZombieNinjaRobotSchoolsGirlsAgainstDragons'

For the minimum viable product the main weapon a 'discombobulating sword' will be used to attack the dragon. The most
exciting thing about he discombobulating sword is that every N (a number still to be decided) attacks the sword will
discombobulate the target (effects still to be decided) so it's critical that you record how many times it is used.

Each location on the dragon has hitpoints, and when that location is hit the damage of the weapon is 
subtracted from the hitpoints. 

The data structure is being maintained by the Asperanto data management group, and mustn't be changed, 
but the methods in the  game class are under your control and you can change the signature of them if you want

You don't need to worry about exception handling.
